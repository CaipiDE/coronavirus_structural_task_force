Original model has numerous quite severe (albeit local) problems:

- spurious non-proline cis/twisted peptide bonds at A281-282, A285-286, A350-351, A353-354, A439-440, 
  A551-552, B-1-0, B189-190, B206-207, B467-468
- high clashscore of 28.7
- only 79.6% of residues in favoured portion of Ramachandran plot (should be near 98%)
- C-terminal domains (~439 to end) nearly unresolved and severely distorted
- Some long loops were modelled despite having no discernable density.

Rebuilt well-resolved regions directly into density. Trimmed off unresolved loops. 
In the MERS equivalent of this complex (5wwp) the C-terminal domain is well-resolved (but needed 
substantial rebuilding in its own right). After rebuilding, I used this (chain A, residues 439 to end)
as a reference model (distance and torsion-based) to improve the poorly-resolved C-terminal domains
in 6jyt. Given the poor density it cannot be said that these domains are perfect, but application of 
the restraints substantially improved both R-factors and geometry.

Original model:

  Ramachandran outliers =   4.97 %
                favored =  79.60 %
  Rotamer outliers      =   0.77 %
  C-beta deviations     =     1
  Clashscore            =  28.71
  RMS(bonds)            =   0.0138
  RMS(angles)           =   1.69
  MolProbity score      =   2.69
  Resolution            =   2.80
  R-work                =   0.2380
  R-free                =   0.2930
 
Revised model:

  Ramachandran outliers =   0.00 %
                favored =  96.01 %
  Rotamer outliers      =   0.79 %
  C-beta deviations     =     0
  Clashscore            =   2.65
  RMS(bonds)            =   0.0106
  RMS(angles)           =   1.19
  MolProbity score      =   1.33
  Resolution            =   2.80
  R-work                =   0.2325
  R-free                =   0.2688
