SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 119 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 11 residues (9.2%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (5.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (2.52%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 15 residues (12.61%) are helix-like, 32 residues (26.89%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
