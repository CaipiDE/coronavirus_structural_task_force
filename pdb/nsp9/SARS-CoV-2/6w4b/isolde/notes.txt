Backbone conformation was already essentially correct throughout. About 2 dozen sidechains had incorrect rotamers, and another dozen were unmodelled. These could be justified (essentially unresolved in the density), but given that ISOLDE's MD environment is generally good at keeping them under control I opted to add them in. Also simplified the TLS model to one TLS group per chain.
