SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 118 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 15 residues (12.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (6.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (2.54%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 18 residues (15.25%) are helix-like, 35 residues (29.66%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
