SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 411 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 33 residues (8.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 12 residues (2.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 6 residues (1.46%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 51 residues (12.41%) are helix-like, 109 residues (26.52%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
