SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 213 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 19 residues (8.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (5.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.88%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 28 residues (13.15%) are helix-like, 63 residues (29.58%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.94%) are correctable to beta
