This directory contains a subdirectory for each protein known from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 and subdirectories relating to the virus.  

In each subfolder, you can find a file called proteome_information.txt with infos on the proteome and alternative protein names and a file called sequence_info.txt with infos on the sequence in FASTA-format and identity to its relative.

There are extra folders for structures containing more than one protein from CoV:
nsp12-nsp7-nsp8
nsp14-nsp10
nsp16-nsp10

The folder non-SARS_structures contains other beta-Coronavirus structures, for example from MERS.
