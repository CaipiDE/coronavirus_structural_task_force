This directory contains a subdirectory for each protein known from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 and subdirectories relating to the virus.  

In each subfolder, you can find a file called proteome_information.txt with infos on the proteome and alternative protein names and a file called sequence_info.txt with infos on the sequence in FASTA-format and identity to its relative.

There are extra folders for structures containing more than one protein from CoV:
nsp12-nsp7-nsp8
nsp14-nsp10
nsp16-nsp10

The folder non-SARS_structures contains other beta-Coronavirus structures, for example from MERS.

Folder names which changed / were merged since the upload:
 04.04.2020 nsp13 -> helicase
 05.04.2020 nsp16 -> methyltransferase
 05.04.2020 e2_glycoprotein_precursor -> surface glycoprotein
 05.04.2020 nsp12 -> rna polymerase

In the human_interaction_partners folder you will find 3 different human proteins (121 structures) which have a direct relationship with CoV-proteins. You can get more information in human_interaction_partner/infos.txt

Structures wich were revised will be uploaded, you will find the old structures in /old in the protein folder.

In each supfolder you will find a file structure_sequence_alignment.txt with a alignment of the sequence which is found in the pdb file and the sequence from the reference genome
