- existing model is generally very good. Various residues had unmodelled sidechains (some of which I completed). Most of these are pointing into empty space and clearly flexible - trivial to add if one wishes to perform MD. Lys D144 was the exception: this points into a tightly constrained cavity and H-bonds to the backbone to stabilise a turn. Note that this residue was already modelled correctly in the other three chains.
