SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 467 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 40 residues (8.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (1.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 11 residues (2.36%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 13 residues (2.78%) are helix-like, 128 residues (27.41%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.21%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
