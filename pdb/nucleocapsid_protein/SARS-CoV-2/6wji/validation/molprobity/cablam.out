SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 624 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 27 residues (4.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (1.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 6 residues (0.96%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 198 residues (31.73%) are helix-like, 110 residues (17.63%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
