SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 426 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 18 residues (4.2%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.70%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 133 residues (31.22%) are helix-like, 70 residues (16.43%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
