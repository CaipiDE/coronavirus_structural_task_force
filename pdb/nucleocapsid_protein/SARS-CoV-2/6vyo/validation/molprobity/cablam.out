SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 483 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 31 residues (6.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 10 residues (2.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 8 residues (1.66%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 17 residues (3.52%) are helix-like, 118 residues (24.43%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
