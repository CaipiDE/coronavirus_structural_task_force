The protein component of the existing model is fine - great, in fact. However, each zinc coordination site (Asp82,His145,His59') has a secondary blob associated with it that is also modelled as Zn2+ - this is chemically infeasible. Anomalous scattering (thanks to Randy Read for this), bond lengths and general chemical reasoning all indicate these are actually chloride ions - and, given that they are clearly very tightly bound under sub-physiological concentrations (buffer contained only 10 mM ZnCl2, 100 mM MES, and 20% PEG), are probably functionally relevant.
