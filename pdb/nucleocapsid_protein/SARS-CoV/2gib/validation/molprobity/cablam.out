SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 185 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 9 residues (4.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.54%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 58 residues (31.35%) are helix-like, 33 residues (17.84%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
