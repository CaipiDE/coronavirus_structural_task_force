SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 405 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 30 residues (7.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (2.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.74%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 96 residues (23.70%) are helix-like, 83 residues (20.49%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
