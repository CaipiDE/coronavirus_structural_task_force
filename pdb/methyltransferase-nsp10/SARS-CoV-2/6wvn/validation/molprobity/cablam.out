SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 414 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 21 residues (5.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 100 residues (24.15%) are helix-like, 90 residues (21.74%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
