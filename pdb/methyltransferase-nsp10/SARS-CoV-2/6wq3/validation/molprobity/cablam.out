SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 406 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 23 residues (5.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 93 residues (22.91%) are helix-like, 88 residues (21.67%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
