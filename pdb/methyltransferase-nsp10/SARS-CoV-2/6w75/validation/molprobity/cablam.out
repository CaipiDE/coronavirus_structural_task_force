SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 806 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 43 residues (5.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.25%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 180 residues (22.33%) are helix-like, 176 residues (21.84%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.12%) are correctable to beta
