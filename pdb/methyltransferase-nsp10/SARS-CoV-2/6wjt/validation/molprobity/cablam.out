SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 808 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 43 residues (5.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 10 residues (1.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.37%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 186 residues (23.02%) are helix-like, 177 residues (21.91%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.12%) are correctable to beta
