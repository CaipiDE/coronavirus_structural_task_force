SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 402 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 25 residues (6.2%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (1.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.25%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 85 residues (21.14%) are helix-like, 85 residues (21.14%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
