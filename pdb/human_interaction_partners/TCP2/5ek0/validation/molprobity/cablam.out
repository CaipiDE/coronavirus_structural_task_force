SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 955 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 64 residues (6.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 20 residues (2.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.10%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 792 residues (82.93%) are helix-like, 0 residues (0.00%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 8 residues (0.84%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
