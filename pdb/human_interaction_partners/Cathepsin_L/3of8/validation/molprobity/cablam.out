SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 217 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 28 residues (12.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (4.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.84%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 46 residues (21.20%) are helix-like, 23 residues (10.60%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
