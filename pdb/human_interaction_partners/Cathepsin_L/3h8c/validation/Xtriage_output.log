=================== Solvent content and Matthews coefficient ==================


 Number of residues unknown, assuming 50% solvent content

  Best guess :  415 residues in the ASU

 Caution: this estimate is based on the distribution of solvent content across
 structures in the PDB, but it does not take into account the resolution of
 the data (which is strongly correlated with solvent content) or the physical
 properties of the model (such as oligomerization state, et cetera).  If you
 encounter problems with molecular replacement and/or refinement, you may need
 to consider the possibility that the ASU contents are different than expected.


======================== Data strength and completeness =======================

Overall <I/sigma> for this dataset is    29.3

              ----------Completeness at I/sigma cutoffs----------


 The following table lists the completeness in various resolution ranges,
 after applying a I/sigI cut. Miller indices for which individual I/sigI
 values are larger than the value specified in the top row of the table, are
 retained, while other intensities are discarded. The resulting completeness
 profiles are an indication of the strength of the data.


                          **********WARNING**********

Please be aware that the input data were given as amplitudes and squared for
the purposes of this analysis, therefore the numbers displayed here are less
reliable than the values calculated from the raw intensities.

  The completeness of data for which I/sig(I)>3.00, exceeds 85 %
  for resolution ranges lower than 3.08A.
  The data are cut at this resolution for the potential twin tests and
  intensity statistics.


            ----------Low resolution completeness analyses----------

The following table shows the completeness of the data to 5.0 A.  Poor
low-resolution completeness often leads to map distortions and other
difficulties, and is typically caused by problems with the crystal orientation
during data collection, overexposure of frames, interference with the beamstop,
or omission of reflections by data-processing software.

The table below presents an alternative overview of data completeness, using
the entire resolution range but on a logarithmic scale.  This is more sensitive
to missing low-resolution data (and is complementary to the separate table
showing low-resolution completeness only).

  --------------------------------------------------

               ----------Analysis of resolution limits----------

Your data have been examined to determine the resolution limits of the data
along the reciprocal space axes (a*, b*, and c*).  These are expected to vary
slightly depending on unit cell parameters and overall resolution, but should
never be significantly different for complete data.  (This is distinct from the
amount of anisotropy present in the data, which changes the effective
resolution but does not actually exclude reflections.)

    overall d_min                = 2.501
    d_min along a*               = 2.633
    d_min along b*               = 2.566
    d_min along c*               = 2.550
    max. difference between axes = 0.083

Resolution limits are within expected tolerances.

             Resolution:                   44.0821 - 2.50146

  Number of reflections:                               15691
           Completeness:                              96.08%

  Completeness should be used to determine if there is sufficient data for
  refinement and/or model-building. A value greater than 90% is generally
  desired, while a value less than 75% is considered poor. Values in between
  will provide less than optimal results.
  

===================== Absolute scaling and Wilson analysis ====================


        ----------Maximum likelihood isotropic Wilson scaling----------

 ML estimate of overall B value of /mntdirect/_data_id30a3_inhouse/gianluca/coronavirus_structural_task_force/pdb/human_interaction_partners/Cathepsin_L/3h8c/3h8c.mtz:FP,SIGFP:

    0.60
 The overall B value ("Wilson B-factor", derived from the Wilson plot) gives
 an isotropic approximation for the falloff of intensity as a function of
 resolution.  Note that this approximation may be misleading for anisotropic
 data (where the crystal is poorly ordered along an axis).  The Wilson B is
 strongly correlated with refined atomic B-factors but these may differ by
 a significant amount, especially if anisotropy is present.

                    ----------Anisotropy analyses----------


 For the resolution shell spanning between 2.63 - 2.50 Angstrom,
 the mean I/sigI is equal to  4.18. 44.1 % of these intensities have
 an I/sigI > 3. When sorting these intensities by their anisotropic
 correction factor and analysing the I/sigI behavior for this ordered
 list, we can gauge the presence of 'anisotropy induced noise amplification'
 in reciprocal space.

 The quarter of Intensities *least* affected by the anisotropy correction show

    <I/sigI>                 :   4.60e+00
    Fraction of I/sigI > 3   :   4.77e-01     ( Z =     1.61 )
  The quarter of Intensities *most* affected by the anisotropy correction show

    <I/sigI>                 :   2.90e+00
    Fraction of I/sigI > 3   :   3.34e-01     ( Z =     4.84 )
 Z-scores are computed on the basis of a Bernoulli model assuming independence
 of weak reflections with respect to anisotropy.

                        ----------Wilson plot----------

 The Wilson plot shows the falloff in intensity as a function in resolution;
 this is used to calculate the overall B-factor ("Wilson B-factor") for the
 data shown above.  The expected plot is calculated based on analysis of
 macromolecule structures in the PDB, and the distinctive appearance is due to
 the non-random arrangement of atoms in the crystal.  Some variation is
 natural, but major deviations from the expected plot may indicate pathological
 data (including ice rings, detector problems, or processing errors).

                  ----------Mean intensity analyses----------

 Inspired by: Morris et al. (2004). J. Synch. Rad.11, 56-59.
 The following resolution shells are worrisome:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  | Mean intensity by shell (outliers)                            |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | d_spacing     | z_score       | completeness  | <Iobs>/<Iexp> |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------|
  |     3.071     |    5.30       |    0.98       |      0.788    |
  |     3.015     |    5.06       |    0.98       |      0.799    |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

 Possible reasons for the presence of the reported unexpected low or elevated
 mean intensity in a given resolution bin are :
   - missing overloaded or weak reflections
   - suboptimal data processing
   - satellite (ice) crystals
   - NCS
   - translational pseudo symmetry (detected elsewhere)
   - outliers (detected elsewhere)
   - ice rings (detected elsewhere)
   - other problems
 Note that the presence of abnormalities in a certain region of reciprocal
 space might confuse the data validation algorithm throughout a large region
 of reciprocal space, even though the data are acceptable in those areas.



                     ----------Possible outliers----------

Acentric reflections:
            None

Centric reflections:
            None


                 ----------Ice ring related problems----------

 The following statistics were obtained from ice-ring insensitive resolution
 ranges:

    mean bin z_score      : 1.93
        ( rms deviation   : 1.23 )
    mean bin completeness : 0.97
        ( rms deviation   : 0.05 )

 The following table shows the Wilson plot Z-scores and completeness for
 observed data in ice-ring sensitive areas.  The expected relative intensity
 is the theoretical intensity of crystalline ice at the given resolution.
 Large z-scores and high completeness in these resolution ranges might
 be a reason to re-assess your data processsing if ice rings were present.

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  | d_spacing | Expected rel. I | Data Z-score | Completeness |
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  |     3.897 |      1.000      |    1.31      |    1.00      |
  |     3.669 |      0.750      |    0.96      |    0.99      |
  |     3.441 |      0.530      |    2.93      |    0.99      |
  |     2.671 |      0.170      |    0.16      |    0.96      |
  -------------------------------------------------------------
 Abnormalities in mean intensity or completeness at resolution ranges with a
 relative ice ring intensity lower than 0.10 will be ignored.
 No ice ring related problems detected.
 If ice rings were present, the data does not look worse at ice ring related
 d_spacings as compared to the rest of the data set.

============================= Systematic absences =============================


             ----------Table of systematic absence rules----------

 The following table gives information about systematic absences allowed for
 the specified intensity point group.

 For each operator, the reflections are split in three classes:


  Systematic absence: Reflections that are absent for this operator.
  Non absence       : Reflections of the same type (i.e. (0,0,l)) as above, but they
                      should be present.
  Other reflections : All other reflections.

For each class, the <I/sigI> is reported, as well as the number of
violations. A violation is a reflection that is absent when it is expected
to be present for a particular space group, or present when it is
expected to be absent. The criteria are:

  Systematic absence violation: I/sigI > 3.0
  Non absence violation       : I/sigI < 3.0
  Other relections violation  : I/sigI < 3.0

Operators with low associated violations for *both* systematically absent and
non absent reflections, are likely to be true screw axis or glide planes. Both
the number of violations and their percentages are given.  The number of
violations within the 'other reflections' class, can be used as a comparison
for the number of violations in the non-absent class.

                 ----------Space group identification----------

Analyses of the absences table indicates a number of likely space group
candidates, which are listed below. For each space group, the number of
systematic absence violations are listed under the '+++' column. The number of
non-absence violations (weak reflections) are listed under '---'. The last
column is a likelihood based score for the particular space group.  Note that
enantiomorphic spacegroups will have equal scores. Also, if absences were
removed while processing the data, they will be regarded as missing
information, rather then as enforcing that absence in the space group choices.

           ----------List of individual systematic absences----------

 Note: this analysis uses the original input data rather than the filtered data
 used for twinning detection; therefore, the results shown here may include
 more reflections than shown above.

 Also note that the input data were amplitudes, which means that weaker
 reflections may have been modified by French-Wilson treatment or discarded
 altogether, and the original intensities will not be recovered.

P 2 2 2: no systematic absences possible
P 2 2 21: no absences found
P 21 2 2: no absences found
P 2 21 2: no absences found

=============== Diagnostic tests for twinning and pseudosymmetry ==============

Using data between 10.00 to 3.08 Angstrom.

                     ----------Patterson analyses----------

 Largest Patterson peak with length larger than 15 Angstrom:
 Frac. coord.              :    0.000    0.000    0.292
 Distance to origin        :   38.767
 Height relative to origin :    5.309 %
 p_value(height)           :    8.617e-01

Explanation
 The p-value, the probability that a peak of the specified height or larger
 is found in a Patterson function of a macromolecule that does not have any
 translational pseudo-symmetry, is equal to 8.617e-01.  p_values smaller than
 0.05 might indicate weak translational pseudo symmetry, or the self vector of
 a large anomalous scatterer such as Hg, whereas values smaller than 1e-3 are
 a very strong indication for the presence of translational pseudo symmetry.


                  ----------Wilson ratio and moments----------

Acentric reflections:


   <I^2>/<I>^2    :1.969   (untwinned: 2.000; perfect twin 1.500)
   <F>^2/<F^2>    :0.793   (untwinned: 0.785; perfect twin 0.885)
   <|E^2 - 1|>    :0.734   (untwinned: 0.736; perfect twin 0.541)

Centric reflections:


   <I^2>/<I>^2    :2.706   (untwinned: 3.000; perfect twin 2.000)
   <F>^2/<F^2>    :0.681   (untwinned: 0.637; perfect twin 0.785)
   <|E^2 - 1|>    :0.907   (untwinned: 0.968; perfect twin 0.736)


               ----------NZ test for twinning and TNCS----------


The NZ test is diagnostic for both twinning and translational NCS.  Note
however that if both are present, the effects may cancel each other out,
therefore the results of the Patterson analysis and L-test also need to be
considered.

                  ----------L test for acentric data----------

Using difference vectors (dh,dk,dl) of the form:
    (2hp, 2kp, 2lp)
where hp, kp, and lp are random signed integers such that
    2 <= |dh| + |dk| + |dl| <= 8
  Mean |L|   :0.480  (untwinned: 0.500; perfect twin: 0.375)
  Mean  L^2  :0.314  (untwinned: 0.333; perfect twin: 0.200)

 The distribution of |L| values indicates a twin fraction of
 0.00. Note that this estimate is not as reliable as obtained
 via a Britton plot or H-test if twin laws are available.

================================== Twin laws ==================================


                  ----------Twin law identification----------

Possible twin laws:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Type | Axis   | R metric (%) | delta (le Page) | delta (Lebedev) | Twin law |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  PM  | 2-fold | 1.043        | 1.067           | 0.015           | k,h,-l   |
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0   merohedral twin operators found
1   pseudo-merohedral twin operators found
In total,   1 twin operators were found

 Please note that the possibility of twin laws only means that the lattice
 symmetry permits twinning; it does not mean that the data are actually
 twinned.  You should only treat the data as twinned if the intensity
 statistics are abnormal.

                  ----------Twin law-specific tests----------

 The following tests analyze the input data with each of the possible twin
 laws applied.  If twinning is present, the most appropriate twin law will
 usually have a low R_abs_twin value and a consistent estimate of the twin
 fraction (significantly above 0) from each test.  The results are also
 compiled in the summary section.

 WARNING: please remember that the possibility of twin laws, and the results
 of the specific tests, does not guarantee that twinning is actually present
 in the data.  Only the presence of abnormal intensity statistics (as judged
 by the Wilson moments, NZ-test, and L-test) is diagnostic for twinning.


                ----------Analysis of twin law k,h,-l----------

H-test on acentric data
Only 50.0 % of the strongest twin pairs were used.

  mean |H| : 0.421  (0.50: untwinned; 0.0: 50% twinned)
  mean H^2 : 0.258  (0.33: untwinned; 0.0: 50% twinned)

Estimation of twin fraction via mean |H|: 0.079
Estimation of twin fraction via cum. dist. of H: 0.058

Britton analyses

  Extrapolation performed on  0.00 < alpha < 0.495
  Estimated twin fraction: 0.030
  Correlation: 0.9969

R vs R statistics
  R_abs_twin = <|I1-I2|>/<|I1+I2|>
    (Lebedev, Vagin, Murshudov. Acta Cryst. (2006). D62, 83-95)
  R_abs_twin observed data   : 0.448
   R_abs_twin calculated data : 0.451
  R_sq_twin = <(I1-I2)^2>/<(I1+I2)^2>
  R_sq_twin observed data    : 0.264
  R_sq_twin calculated data  : 0.213
Correlation analyses

  The supplied calculated data are normalized and artificially twinned;
  subsequently a correlation with the observed data is computed.

Correlation : 0.882
Estimated twin fraction : 0.010

======================= Exploring higher metric symmetry ======================


The point group of data as dictated by the space group is P 2 2 2
The point group in the niggli setting is P 2 2 2
The point group of the lattice is P 4 2 2
A summary of R values for various possible point groups follow.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Point group | mean R_used | max R_used | mean R_unused | min R_unused | BIC       | choice |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | P 4 2 2     | 0.448       | 0.448      |  None         |  None        | 1.687e+06 |        |
  | P 2 2 2     |  None       |  None      | 0.448         | 0.448        | 3.831e+04 |        |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

R_used: mean and maximum R value for symmetry operators *used* in this point group
R_unused: mean and minimum R value for symmetry operators *not used* in this point group


An automated point group suggestion is made on the basis of the BIC (Bayesian
information criterion).

The likely point group of the data is: P 2 2 2

Possible space groups in this point group are:
   Unit cell: (57.922, 59.011, 132.616, 90, 90, 90)
   Space group: P 21 21 21 (No. 19)


Note that this analysis does not take into account the effects of twinning.
If the data are (almost) perfectly twinned, the symmetry will appear to be
higher than it actually is.


================== Twinning and intensity statistics summary ==================


                       ----------Final verdict----------


The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 5.31% of the
height of the origin peak. No significant pseudotranslation is detected.

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics behave as
expected. No twinning is suspected.

            ----------Statistics independent of twin laws----------

  <I^2>/<I>^2 : 1.969  (untwinned: 2.0, perfect twin: 1.5)
  <F>^2/<F^2> : 0.793  (untwinned: 0.785, perfect twin: 0.885)
  <|E^2-1|>   : 0.734  (untwinned: 0.736, perfect twin: 0.541)
  <|L|>       : 0.480  (untwinned: 0.500; perfect twin: 0.375)
  <L^2>       : 0.314  (untwinned: 0.333; perfect twin: 0.200)
  Multivariate Z score L-test: 2.423


 The multivariate Z score is a quality measure of the given spread in
 intensities. Good to reasonable data are expected to have a Z score lower
 than 3.5.  Large values can indicate twinning, but small values do not
 necessarily exclude it.  Note that the expected values for perfect twinning
 are for merohedrally twinned structures, and deviations from untwinned will
 be larger for perfect higher-order twinning.
