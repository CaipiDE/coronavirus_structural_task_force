SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 208 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 19 residues (9.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (2.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.92%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 45 residues (21.63%) are helix-like, 27 residues (12.98%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
