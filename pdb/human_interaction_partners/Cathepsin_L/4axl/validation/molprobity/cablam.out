SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 216 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 24 residues (11.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (3.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.39%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 45 residues (20.83%) are helix-like, 30 residues (13.89%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
