SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 209 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 22 residues (10.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (3.3%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.96%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 43 residues (20.57%) are helix-like, 30 residues (14.35%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
