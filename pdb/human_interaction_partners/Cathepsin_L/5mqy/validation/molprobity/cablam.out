SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 208 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 26 residues (12.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (2.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.44%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 44 residues (21.15%) are helix-like, 25 residues (12.02%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
