SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 211 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 22 residues (10.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (3.3%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.42%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 44 residues (20.85%) are helix-like, 29 residues (13.74%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
