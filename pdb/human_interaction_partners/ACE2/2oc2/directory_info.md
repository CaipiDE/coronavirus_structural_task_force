## Files downloaded from wwPDB:

2oc2.pdb and 2oc2.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

2oc2-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

2oc2.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.
