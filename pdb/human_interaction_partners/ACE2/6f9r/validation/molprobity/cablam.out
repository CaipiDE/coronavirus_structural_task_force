SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1195 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 39 residues (3.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (0.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.17%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 696 residues (58.24%) are helix-like, 60 residues (5.02%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
