SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 783 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 38 residues (4.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.13%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 367 residues (46.87%) are helix-like, 75 residues (9.58%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
