SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 783 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 45 residues (5.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (1.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.64%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 357 residues (45.59%) are helix-like, 80 residues (10.22%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.13%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (0.38%) are correctable to beta
