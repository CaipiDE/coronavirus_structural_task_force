SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 582 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 23 residues (4.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.34%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 339 residues (58.25%) are helix-like, 31 residues (5.33%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
