- Rebuilt primarily because 6m0j (RBD-ACE2 complex) appears to be missing the Asn103 glycan, leading to what is probably a non-physiological conformation at that site with Asn103 pointing into the active site cleft.
- original authors were unable to fully build and assign sequence to the C-terminal domain. Merged in this domain from 6m17 - fits nicely and is mostly quite well-resolved, but gets very weak at the periphery - the 623-635 loop in particular is very poorly resolved.
- All 5 N-glycan sites are resolved well enough to quite unambiguously assign the position and rotation of the first NAG residue, making this a good scaffold upon which to build a fully-glycosylated model.
- of perhaps passing interest, there is some density in the active cleft which appears consistent with the presence of a low occupancy substrate peptide (particularly strong over the active zinc and in substrate specificity pockets).
