SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 574 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 15 residues (2.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.3%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.17%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 341 residues (59.41%) are helix-like, 35 residues (6.10%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
