This base folder <pdbid> contains files downloaded from wwPDB.

Files:

<pdbid>.pdb and <pdbid>.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

<pdbid>-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

<pdbid>.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.

We do not host Cryo-EM maps, as they are too large. Please download these maps from EMDB@EMBL_EBI: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/
