SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 610 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 39 residues (6.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.33%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 54 residues (8.85%) are helix-like, 181 residues (29.67%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.16%) are correctable to beta
