SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 818 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 60 residues (7.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 13 residues (1.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.37%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 55 residues (6.72%) are helix-like, 258 residues (31.54%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
