SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 406 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 49 residues (12.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 27 residues (6.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.74%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 325 residues (80.05%) are helix-like, 22 residues (5.42%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 16 residues (3.94%) are correctable to helix, 4 residues (0.99%) are correctable to beta
