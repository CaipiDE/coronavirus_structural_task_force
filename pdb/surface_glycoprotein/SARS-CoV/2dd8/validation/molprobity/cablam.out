SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 612 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 58 residues (9.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 13 residues (2.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.33%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 40 residues (6.54%) are helix-like, 201 residues (32.84%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.33%) are correctable to beta
