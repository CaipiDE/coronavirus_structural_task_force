 D1150  ASP: CaBLAM Outlier     :0.00076:0.55324:                 :0.07211:0.00000:0.02330
SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 221 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 152 residues (68.78%) are helix-like, 20 residues (9.05%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
