SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 261 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 35 residues (13.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (3.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 7 residues (2.68%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.15%) are helix-like, 103 residues (39.46%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.38%) are correctable to beta
