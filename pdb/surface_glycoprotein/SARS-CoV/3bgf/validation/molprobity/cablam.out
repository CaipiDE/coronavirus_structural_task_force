SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1171 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 112 residues (9.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 20 residues (1.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.43%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 96 residues (8.20%) are helix-like, 387 residues (33.05%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.17%) are correctable to beta
