## Files downloaded from wwPDB:

3bgf.pdb and 3bgf.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

3bgf-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

3bgf.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.
