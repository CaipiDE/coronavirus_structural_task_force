These are semi-automated refinements done by Agnel Joseph using map processing, model refinement and validation tools in CCP-EM. The deposited maps were locally scaled to account for non-uniform local resolution, using LocScale. The LocScale maps are useful to detect features especially in areas of lower local resolution where global sharpening might have resulted in broken/noisy density. 
The LocScale maps, in combination with related structures which are more complete (more residues built), were used to build missing residues where possible. Missing residues were built and refined in Coot. Geometry outliers were identified using the model validation tool implemented in CCP-EM. Outliers were fixed in Coot where possible, the validation tools implemented in Coot were also used to guide this process. Refmac5 interface in CCP-EM was used to refine the extended and fixed models. Prosmart restraints were used in refinement when higher resolution related structures are available.
