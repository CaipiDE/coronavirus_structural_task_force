EMD-21457 (fitted atomic model: 6vyb)

Re-refined model: 6vyb_extended_refined.pdb
CCP-EM tools - LocScale, Refmac5, Coot, Validation:Model

LocScale map was generated for optimal local scaling of features in the map â€“ a smoothed RBD domain domain density appears. RBD domain was remodelled using co-ordinates of 6m0j. Using related structures solved at higher resolutions (6vxx (fixed in Isolde) and 5x58) as guides, additional residues were traced in the map. Extended models were used to make new LocScale maps. The model is extended by 151 residues.

Outliers (Ramachandran and rotamer) were fixed in Coot. Some of CaBLAM outliers were also fixed where possible - no obvious features to move backbone atoms at this resolution.

Refmac5 was used to refine fixed/extended models. 

The deposited model was probably over-refined for geometry (significantly better than other models at this resolution)
