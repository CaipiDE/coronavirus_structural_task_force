- while this model rebuilds refines quite well, the data in 6m0j is clearer/higher resolution (and in particular supports a more complete model of the receptor binding domain). I would use 6m0j over this one for most purposes.
- B711: NAG should be MAN
- various N-linked glycans poorly modelled (flipped 180 degrees from correct orientation, poor ring geometry, poorly-constrained glycosidic bond to Asn)
- Zn2+ associated with Glu375 seems consistent with density on chain A (note: in 6m0j this is complexed with His374 and His378, but it is detached here). On chain B there is a *very* weak blob of density in the same position - if there is a zinc ion there it is very low occupancy/high B-factor. I removed the one that was modelled here.
- Note the chloride ion between Arg169 and Trp477 - this is also clearly resolved in 6m0j, and appears to play a structural role.
