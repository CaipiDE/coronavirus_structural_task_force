SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 626 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 46 residues (7.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.16%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 45 residues (7.19%) are helix-like, 217 residues (34.66%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
