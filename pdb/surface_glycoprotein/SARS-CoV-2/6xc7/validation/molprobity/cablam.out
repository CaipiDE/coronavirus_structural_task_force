SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1037 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 73 residues (7.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 14 residues (1.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.19%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 63 residues (6.08%) are helix-like, 368 residues (35.49%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.19%) are correctable to beta
