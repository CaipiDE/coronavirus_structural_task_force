SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1232 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 118 residues (9.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 21 residues (1.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 6 residues (0.49%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 75 residues (6.09%) are helix-like, 426 residues (34.58%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.08%) are correctable to helix, 4 residues (0.32%) are correctable to beta
