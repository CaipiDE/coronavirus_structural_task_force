SUMMARY: 112 residues (9.2%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 18 residues (1.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.16%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 92 residues (7.54%) are helix-like, 416 residues (34.10%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.16%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.16%) are correctable to beta
