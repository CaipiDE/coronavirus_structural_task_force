SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 624 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 58 residues (9.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (1.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.32%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 48 residues (7.69%) are helix-like, 208 residues (33.33%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.32%) are correctable to beta
