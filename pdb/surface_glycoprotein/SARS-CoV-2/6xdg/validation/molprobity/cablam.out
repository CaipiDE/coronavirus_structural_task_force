SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1015 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 143 residues (14.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 37 residues (3.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 7 residues (0.69%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 62 residues (6.11%) are helix-like, 337 residues (33.20%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.10%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (0.30%) are correctable to beta
