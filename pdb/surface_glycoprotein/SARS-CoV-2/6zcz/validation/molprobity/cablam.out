SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 734 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 66 residues (9.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (1.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.14%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 50 residues (6.81%) are helix-like, 255 residues (34.74%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.27%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
