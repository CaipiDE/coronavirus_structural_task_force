SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 305 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 23 residues (7.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.66%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 27 residues (8.85%) are helix-like, 87 residues (28.52%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
