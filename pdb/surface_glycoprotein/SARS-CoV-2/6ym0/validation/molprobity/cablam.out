SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 618 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 53 residues (8.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (1.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.49%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 43 residues (6.96%) are helix-like, 215 residues (34.79%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.16%) are correctable to beta
