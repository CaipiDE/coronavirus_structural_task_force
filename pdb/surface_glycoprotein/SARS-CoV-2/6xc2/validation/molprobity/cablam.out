SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1206 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 103 residues (8.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 18 residues (1.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.33%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 92 residues (7.63%) are helix-like, 404 residues (33.50%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.08%) are correctable to beta
