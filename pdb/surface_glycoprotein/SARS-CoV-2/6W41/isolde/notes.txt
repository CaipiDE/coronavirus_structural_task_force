- a few dozen peptide bond and rotamer adjustments (more than you'd expect from the validation report!)
- Important change at antibody-RBD interface: C380-381 and L98-99 peptide bonds flipped (significant role in binding)
- Additionally placed a few solvent ions (sulfates and one citrate) and 10 tightly-bound waters

Original model:

  Ramachandran outliers =   0.00 %
                favored =  97.15 %
  Rotamer outliers      =   0.00 %
  C-beta deviations     =     0
  Clashscore            =   5.57
  RMS(bonds)            =   0.0033
  RMS(angles)           =   0.95
  MolProbity score      =   1.46
  Resolution            =   3.08
  R-work                =   0.2230
  R-free                =   0.2430

Revised model:

  Ramachandran outliers =   0.16 %
                favored =  95.73 %
  Rotamer outliers      =   0.18 %
  C-beta deviations     =     0
  Clashscore            =   0.82
  RMS(bonds)            =   0.0038
  RMS(angles)           =   0.78
  MolProbity score      =   1.05
  Resolution            =   3.08
  R-work                =   0.2117
  R-free                =   0.2380
