SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1848 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 193 residues (10.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 34 residues (1.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.22%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 147 residues (7.95%) are helix-like, 613 residues (33.17%) are beta-like
