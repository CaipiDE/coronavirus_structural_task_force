SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1225 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 75 residues (6.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (0.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.08%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 89 residues (7.27%) are helix-like, 408 residues (33.31%) are beta-like
