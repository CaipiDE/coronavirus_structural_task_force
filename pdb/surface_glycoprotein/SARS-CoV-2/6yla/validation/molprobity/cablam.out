SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1237 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 93 residues (7.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 12 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.32%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 83 residues (6.71%) are helix-like, 437 residues (35.33%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.16%) are correctable to beta
