SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1037 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 65 residues (6.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 12 residues (1.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.29%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 58 residues (5.59%) are helix-like, 372 residues (35.87%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.19%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.10%) are correctable to beta
