Crystal contacts are mediated by some highly unusual (Zn2+)3-(COO-)6 complexes - almost certainly not physiologically relevant, but artefacts of the extreme crystallisation conditions (0.2M zinc acetate). These were mis-modelled as either a single zinc (near A1165) or PEG (near A1184). Additionally, chain F residues 1161-1165 were erroneously modelled as PEG.

Despite this, the protein backbone was mostly modelled quite well, but many sidechains required adjustment.
