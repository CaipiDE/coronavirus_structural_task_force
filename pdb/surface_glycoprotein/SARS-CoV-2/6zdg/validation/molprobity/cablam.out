SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1836 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 162 residues (8.8%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 18 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 9 residues (0.49%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 135 residues (7.35%) are helix-like, 597 residues (32.52%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (0.16%) are correctable to beta
