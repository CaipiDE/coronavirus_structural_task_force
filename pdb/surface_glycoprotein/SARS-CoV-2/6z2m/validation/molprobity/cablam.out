SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1476 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 123 residues (8.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 15 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 6 residues (0.41%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 99 residues (6.71%) are helix-like, 535 residues (36.25%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.14%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.07%) are correctable to beta
