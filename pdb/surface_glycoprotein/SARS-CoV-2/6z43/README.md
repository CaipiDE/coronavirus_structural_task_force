# PDB 6z43

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: NMR

## Description

Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in complex with the H11-D4 nanobody. Non-polymer only hexamer with 6 chains. The H11-D4 nanobody shows neutralising activity for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Another relevant structure is 6yz5 which is the H11-D4 nanobody in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain.
