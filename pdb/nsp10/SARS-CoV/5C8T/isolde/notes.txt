Original model has numerous highly problematic features:
- 20 spurious non-proline cis or twisted peptide bonds
- 127 sidechain outliers
- spurious/impossible bond between Cys B207 SG and CYS B210 CB
- zinc coordination sites highly distorted

That being said, the density itself is strong almost everywhere and quite easy to rebuild into. The bulk of remodelling of chains A and C was accomplished by restraining to my rebuilt model of 3r24 (good quality 2A data, but that model also required extensive rebuilding first). These restraints were then released, and the remainder of rebuilding was directly against the density.

Strange crystallographic artefact near B453: the density makes it look like the backbone fuses with its own symmetry equivalent. Residues B454-464 are unresolved.

  Ramachandran outliers =   0.23 %
                favored =  97.19 %
  Rotamer outliers      =  19.18 %
  C-beta deviations     =     1
  Clashscore            =  31.84
  RMS(bonds)            =   0.0052
  RMS(angles)           =   1.11
  MolProbity score      =   3.11
  Resolution            =   3.20
  R-work                =   0.2430
  R-free                =   0.2650
