SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 302 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 21 residues (7.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (3.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.66%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 69 residues (22.85%) are helix-like, 59 residues (19.54%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.66%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
