# PDB 5reb

## Overview

**Protein name:** 3c like proteinase

**Organism:** SARS-CoV-2

**Method:** X-Ray Diffraction

## Basefolder

5reb.pdb and 5reb.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

5reb-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

5reb.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.

## Comments On The Structure
`Tristan Croll`

The ligand in PDB 5REB is established well enough in the density to be believable, and the conformation looks right.

PDB-REDO gets the ligand wrong- a potential bug. Given its definition in the PDB it is not an aromatic ring, but a piperidine.

In this case we would recommend to use the original structure, potentially with the following changes:
- all amino acid residues should have, when added up, full occupancy (some residues add up to less than occupancy 1 for no good reason, possibly an artifact from the starting structure)
- two waters near the active site that may be DMSO, given the electron density
