The ligand in PDB 5REB is established well enough in the density to be believable, and the conformation looks right.

PDB-REDO gets the ligand wrong- a potential bug. Given its definition in the PDB it is not an aromatic ring, but a piperidine.

In this case we would recommend to use the original structure, potentially with the following changes:
- all amino acid residues should have, when added up, full occupancy (some residues add up to less than occupancy 1 for no good reason, possibly an artifact from the starting structure)
- two waters near the active site that may be DMSO, given the electron density
