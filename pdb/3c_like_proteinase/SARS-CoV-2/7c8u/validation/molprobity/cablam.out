SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 296 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 13 residues (4.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 64 residues (21.62%) are helix-like, 48 residues (16.22%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
