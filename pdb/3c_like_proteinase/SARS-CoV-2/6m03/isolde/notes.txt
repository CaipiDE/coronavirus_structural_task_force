Little to note here. Original model is already very good. Nevertheless, I was able to tighten things up slightly: residues in favoured Ramachandran space up from 96.7 to 97.7%, clashscore down slightly from 4.06 to 3.20 (I believe the only clashes are new waters introduced by Phenix during the final refinement, and are probably harmless), and the Rfree-Rwork gap has closed significantly (original Rwork/Rfree: 0.197/0.248, new 0.209/0.246). The one remaining Ramachandran outlier seems to be harmless (disappears immediately on energy minimisation into the map in ISOLDE).
