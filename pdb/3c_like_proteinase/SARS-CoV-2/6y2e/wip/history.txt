Start from PDB entry.

*Notes*
0.9184 -> 0.2 e- anomalous signal for sulphur, but data sets have high redundancy - use anom. signal to confirm ion, cys and met residue sites?

SCALA has been used. Possibly better results with XSCALE, AIMLESS?

*PDB-REDO*
PDB files do not load in several web services as chain name "AAA". Would recommend to adhere to 2008 wwPDB standard and change this to "A".
Changed chain id from AAA to A.
-> M0rk_final.pdb

*AUSPEX*
Beam stop mask not correct (would like to look at intensities)

*WHAT IF (on original file)*
According to the bond length, the cell is likely 0.5%-0.6% too big due to an error in wavelength or detector distance. Correcting this may avoid some problems with geometry.

Omega angles and other geometry values are sub-optimal. The large difference between R and R-free indicates that the weighting factor in REFMAC should have been lower to guarantee a stronger adherence to ideal geometry. This is also indicated by the following formula:

*Weighting calculation*
R(free) / R(work) = sqrt(1+(0.025*1.5*resolution^3*(1-solventcontent))/1-(0.025*1.5*resolution^3*(1-solventcontent))

R(free) / R(work) = 0.222/0.171 = 1.29
(solventcontent = 0.38; resolution = 1.75)
sqrt(1+(0.025*1.5*resolution^3*(1-solventcontent))/1-(0.025*1.5*resolution^3*(1-solventcontent)) =  1.133 -> R(free) / R(work) needs to be smaller!

*Changes after PDB-REDO*
starting from M0rk_final.pdb
Changed CRYST card to:
CRYST1  114.509   53.473   44.565  90.00 101.251  90.00 C 1 2 1 

AAA  26 THR rotamer change to m
AAA  41 HIS disordered with flip
AAA  45-48 needs to be real-space-refined to avoid internal hydrophobic clashes 
AAA  47 GLU side chain should not be at full occupancy; rotamer uncommon
AAA  69 GLN flip
AAA  74 GLN different side chain conformation, perhaps flip
AAA  87 LEU sidechain needs to rotate to rotamer mt 
AAA  96 PRO unusual puckering -> changed to most common rotamer
AAA 110 GLN different rotamer
AAA 127 GLN side chain flip!!
AAA 128 CYS something is bound to S (perhaps raddam?) - ask Elspeth? Split residue.

AAA 154 TYR side chain does not fit; different residue or disordered; Ramachandran outlier
AAA 165 MET Conformation B terminal CH3 needs to point somewhere else, and rotamer is an outlier
AAA 203 ASN side chain flip!!
AAA 217 ARG needs to go into green density: change to rotamer mtm-85
AAA 222 ARG side chain not at full occupancy, poor packing
AAA 223 PHE half the side chain has no density -> other residue?
AAA 228 ASN other residue?
AAA 246 HIS flip and put water in green blob next to N
AAA 254 SER might be THR or disordered SER
AAA 288 GLU is disordered and AAA 401 HOH is wrong; NH has no hydrogen bonding partner
AAA 303-304 can be adjusted with real space refine to better fit the density.
AAA 306 ASN flip; is this side chain the correct residue? - maybe main chain and side chain positions need to be changed!
If 306 happens to be the last residue, OXT is missing (but I don't think it's the last.)
AAA 404 HOH is an ion
AAA 410 HOH perhaps an ion?
AAA 437 HOH perhaps an ion
AAA 450 HOH lower occupancy or delete
AAA 487 HOH perhaps an ion
AAA 488 HOH perhaps an ion
AAA 493 HOH perhaps an ion
AAA 521 HOH too close to HOH 592: alternative positions, or other small molecule
AAA 533 HOH too close to HOH 682: alternative positions, or other small molecule
AAA 556 HOH is an ion
AAA 582 HOH perhaps an ion
AAA 652 HOH delete
AAA 667 HOH delete

Refinement remarks:
try sphere refine on resi 101 to remove clash with 157?
227-229 geometry not ideal
