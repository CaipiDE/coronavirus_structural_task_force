SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 302 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 29 residues (9.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (2.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 5 residues (1.66%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 63 residues (20.86%) are helix-like, 49 residues (16.23%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
