SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 576 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 28 residues (4.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 117 residues (20.31%) are helix-like, 102 residues (17.71%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
