SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 294 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 32 residues (10.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (3.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.02%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 61 residues (20.75%) are helix-like, 48 residues (16.33%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
