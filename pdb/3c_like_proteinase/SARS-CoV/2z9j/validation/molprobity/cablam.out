SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 598 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 42 residues (7.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (1.5%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.17%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 127 residues (21.24%) are helix-like, 105 residues (17.56%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.17%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.33%) are correctable to beta
