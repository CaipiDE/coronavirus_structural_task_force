SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 298 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 27 residues (9.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (2.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 65 residues (21.81%) are helix-like, 51 residues (17.11%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.34%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
