SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 386 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 23 residues (6.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 10 residues (2.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 187 residues (48.45%) are helix-like, 33 residues (8.55%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.52%) are correctable to beta
