SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 597 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 55 residues (9.2%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (1.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.34%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 125 residues (20.94%) are helix-like, 104 residues (17.42%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.17%) are correctable to beta
