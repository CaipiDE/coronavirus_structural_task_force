SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 273 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 30 residues (11.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 10 residues (3.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.37%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 59 residues (21.61%) are helix-like, 47 residues (17.22%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.73%) are correctable to beta
