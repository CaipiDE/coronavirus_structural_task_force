SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 297 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 24 residues (8.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (2.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 63 residues (21.21%) are helix-like, 49 residues (16.50%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (1.01%) are correctable to beta
