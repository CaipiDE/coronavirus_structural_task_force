SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 295 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 35 residues (11.9%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (3.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 62 residues (21.02%) are helix-like, 57 residues (19.32%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.68%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
