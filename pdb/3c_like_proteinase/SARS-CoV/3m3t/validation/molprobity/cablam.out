SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 303 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 41 residues (13.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 15 residues (5.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.33%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 59 residues (19.47%) are helix-like, 49 residues (16.17%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
