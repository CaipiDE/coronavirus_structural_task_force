3sn8.pdb and 3sn8.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

3sn8-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

3sn8.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.
