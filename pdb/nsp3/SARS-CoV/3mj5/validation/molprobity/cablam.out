SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 566 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 49 residues (8.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 15 residues (2.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.71%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 142 residues (25.09%) are helix-like, 126 residues (22.26%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (0.53%) are correctable to beta
