SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 384 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 36 residues (9.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 14 residues (3.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.04%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 86 residues (22.40%) are helix-like, 94 residues (24.48%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.26%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.26%) are correctable to beta
