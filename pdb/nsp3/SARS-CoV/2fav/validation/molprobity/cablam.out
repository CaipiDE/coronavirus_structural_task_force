SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 502 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 25 residues (5.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (1.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.20%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 176 residues (35.06%) are helix-like, 71 residues (14.14%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.20%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
