SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 313 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 30 residues (9.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (2.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 8 residues (2.56%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 75 residues (23.96%) are helix-like, 69 residues (22.04%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.32%) are correctable to beta
