SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 313 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 21 residues (6.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.3%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.64%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 74 residues (23.64%) are helix-like, 72 residues (23.00%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
