SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 385 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 17 residues (4.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (1.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.78%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 88 residues (22.86%) are helix-like, 95 residues (24.68%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.26%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.26%) are correctable to beta
