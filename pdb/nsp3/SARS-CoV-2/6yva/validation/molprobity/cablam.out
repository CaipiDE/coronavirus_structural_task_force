SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 422 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 34 residues (8.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 11 residues (2.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.47%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 91 residues (21.56%) are helix-like, 102 residues (24.17%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (0.47%) are correctable to beta
