SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 168 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 10 residues (6.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.8%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.60%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 56 residues (33.33%) are helix-like, 24 residues (14.29%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.60%) are correctable to beta
