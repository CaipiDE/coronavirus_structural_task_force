SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 841 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 38 residues (4.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 9 residues (1.1%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.24%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 277 residues (32.94%) are helix-like, 109 residues (12.96%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
