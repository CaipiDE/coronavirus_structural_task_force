SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1140 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 57 residues (5.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 18 residues (1.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 9 residues (0.79%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 265 residues (23.25%) are helix-like, 260 residues (22.81%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.09%) are correctable to helix, 3 residues (0.26%) are correctable to beta
