SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 309 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 17 residues (5.5%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (1.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.97%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 79 residues (25.57%) are helix-like, 70 residues (22.65%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.32%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
