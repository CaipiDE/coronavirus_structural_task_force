SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 327 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 12 residues (3.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.31%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 109 residues (33.33%) are helix-like, 42 residues (12.84%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
