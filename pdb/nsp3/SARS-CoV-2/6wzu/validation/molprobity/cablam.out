SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 311 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 18 residues (5.8%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (2.3%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (1.29%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 76 residues (24.44%) are helix-like, 70 residues (22.51%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.32%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.32%) are correctable to beta
