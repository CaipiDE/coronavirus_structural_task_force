SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 162 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 7 residues (4.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.62%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 55 residues (33.95%) are helix-like, 21 residues (12.96%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.62%) are correctable to beta
