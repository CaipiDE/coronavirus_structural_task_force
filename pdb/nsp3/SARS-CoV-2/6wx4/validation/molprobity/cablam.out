SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 316 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 19 residues (6.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 6 residues (1.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.63%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 73 residues (23.10%) are helix-like, 73 residues (23.10%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.32%) are correctable to beta
