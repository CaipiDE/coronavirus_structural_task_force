SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 376 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 21 residues (5.6%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (1.9%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 3 residues (0.80%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 89 residues (23.67%) are helix-like, 81 residues (21.54%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.27%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.27%) are correctable to beta
