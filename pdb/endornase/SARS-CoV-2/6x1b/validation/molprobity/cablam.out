SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 686 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 48 residues (7.0%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.29%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 146 residues (21.28%) are helix-like, 154 residues (22.45%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
