SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 688 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 35 residues (5.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 5 residues (0.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.29%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 144 residues (20.93%) are helix-like, 152 residues (22.09%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
