SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 687 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 44 residues (6.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 7 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.15%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 145 residues (21.11%) are helix-like, 157 residues (22.85%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
