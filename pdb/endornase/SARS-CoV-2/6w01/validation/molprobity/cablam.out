SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 686 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 44 residues (6.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 8 residues (1.2%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.29%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 142 residues (20.70%) are helix-like, 153 residues (22.30%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
