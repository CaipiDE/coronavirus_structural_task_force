These are manual re-refinements from coot and REFMAC5 done by Dr. Sam Horrell. Structures were validated using inbuilt validation tools from coot in combination with validation through the molprobity server (Duke University School of Medicine). 

Files (not all of these will be present in any given directory):
<pdbid> reprocessing.docx – Notes, figures, and statistics highlighting key differences from reprocessing 
<pdbid>_refmac.mtz – Map amplitudes and phases calculated by Refmac5
<pdbid>_refmac.pdb – Model rebuilt in Coot and refined Refmac5
<pdbid>_refmac.mmcif - Model rebuilt in Coot and refined Refmac5
<pdbid>_TLSOUT.mtz – Refined TLS parameters from Refmac5
<pdbid>_log.txt – Log file from Refmac5
