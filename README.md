# CORONAVIRUS STRUCTURAL TASKFORCE

A global public resource for the structures from beta-coronavirus with a focus on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

## What is this?

This repository is a global public resource for the structures from beta-coronavirus with a focus on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
You can find here:
* The original files for 19 of the 28 proteins in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, over 300 different structures.
* Re-refined structures from different contributors(*)
* Validation statistics for these and the original structural models
* Diagnostic data for the quality of the experimental data

(*) Please be aware that while there is potential to improve some structures, this is not meant as criticism of the great achievements of the research groups who were able to initially elucidate these structures. It merely reflects on the potential to push our methods to their limit.

## Why?

We are methods developers in structural biology. During this time of crisis, we  decided to put or brains to where our hearts are. We hope this can make a (small) difference for the cure of COVID-19.

## Download for non-git users

This is a project in progress. While we strongly suggest users to work with Git so that they can synchronize with us conveniently, there is also a possibility to fetch the most recent update as a zip package by clicking the Green Button "Clone or download" and "Download Zip".

## Folder stucture 

In each folder, is a file **directory_info.txt**. It contains information on the file formats used in this directory, and where they came from.

You can find the structures in a folder named like this: `pdb/3c_like_proteinase/SARS-CoV-2/5re5`<br>
Following the scheme: `pdb/protein name/virus name/pdbid`<br><br>

We do not host Cryo-EM maps, as they are too large. Please download these maps from EMDB@EMBL_EBI: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/<br>

In each `pdbid/` directory, there may one or several of the following subfolders:<br>

`validation/`<br>
This folder contains currently output from [phenix.xtriage](https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/xtriage.html#how-xtriage-works). Xtriage analyzes diffraction data for Wilson plot adherence, diffraction strength and twinning.

`validation/pdb-redo/`<br>
This folder contains [pdb-redo](https://pdb-redo.eu/) results (including [whatcheck](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/whatcheck/)). PDB-REDO is a procedure to optimise crystallographic structure models, providing algorithms that make a fully automated decision making system for refinement, rebuilding and validation. 

`isolde/`<br>
These are manual re-refinements from [ISOLDE](https://isolde.cimr.cam.ac.uk/what-isolde/) in [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/), done by Tristan Croll. Structures were energy-minimised, visually checked residue-by-residue and, where necessary, rebuilt. Crystal structures were further refined with [phenix.refine](https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/refinement.html).

`auspex/`<br>
These are results of the analysis of deposited diffraction data with [AUSPEX](www.auspex.de). AUSPEX can help to detect problems in experimental setup, integration, scaling and conversion from intensities to amplitudes.

`haruspex/`<br>
These are results for the splitting of Cryo-EM maps according to secondary structure with the neural network [Haruspex](https://github.com/thorn-lab/haruspex)
