# CORONAVIRUS STRUCTURAL TASKFORCE

A global public resource for the structures from beta-coronavirus with a focus on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

## What is this?

This repository is a global public resource for the structures from beta-coronavirus with a focus on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.


## Why?

During this time of crisis, we basically decided to put or brains to where our hearts are. We hope to make a small difference for the cure of COVID-19.


## Download for non git users

This is a project in progress. While we strongly suggest users to work with Git so that they can synchronize with us conveniently, there is also a possibility to fetch the most recent update as a zip package by clicking the Green Button "Clone or download" and "Download Zip".

## Folder stucture

You can find the structures in a folder like this:
```
pdb/3c_like_proteinase/SARS-CoV-2/5re5
```
Following the scheme<br>
pdb/protein name/virus name/pdbid

In each pdbid directory, there may one or several of the following subfolders:<br><br>
validation/<br>
This folder contains [pdb-redo](https://pdb-redo.eu/) (including [whatcheck](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/whatcheck/)) and [phenix.xtriage](https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/xtriage.html#how-xtriage-works) results.


isolde/<br>
These are manual re-refinements from isolde, done by Tristan Croll.

auspex/<br>
These are results of the analysis of deposited data with [AUSPEX](www.auspex.de)

haruspex/<br>
These are results for the splitting of Cryo-EM maps accorindg to secondary structure with the neural network [Haruspex](https://github.com/thorn-lab/haruspex)
