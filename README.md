## What is this?

This repository is a global public resource for the structures from beta-coronavirus with a focus on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.


## Why?

During this time of crisis, we basically decided to put or brains to where our hearts are. We hope to make a small difference for the cure of COVID-19.


## Download for non git users

This is a project in progress. While we strongly suggest users to work with Git so that they can synchronize with us conveniently, there is also a possibility to fetch the most recent update as a zip package by clicking the Green Button "Clone or download" and "Download Zip".

## Folder stucture

You can find the structures in a folder like this:
pdb/3c_like_proteinase/SARS-CoV-2/5re5
___ __________________ __________ ____
pdb  protein name      virus name pdbid

In each pdbid directory, there may one or several of the following subfolders:
validation/
This folder contains 

isolde/
These are manual re-refinements from isolde, done by Tristan Croll.
